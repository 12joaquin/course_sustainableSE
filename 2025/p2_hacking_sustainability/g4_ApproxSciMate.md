summary: "We apply the paradigm of approximate computing to 3 popular SciPy functions by extending them with levels of varying approximation in a new Python library, ApproxSciMate. Arguments are made towards the need of more environmentally sustainable approaches to computing and this library implements one of these approaches as a proof of concept. The library strives to give users control over the desired accuracy of their computation with hopes that it reduces their environmental impact in less accuracy-dependent use cases."
