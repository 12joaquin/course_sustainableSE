title: "GreenCode: Promoting Eco-Friendly Coding Practices"
date: 28/03/2024
summary: 
  This project introduces GreenCode, a novel approach for identifying energy-efficient Python coding practices in Jupyter notebooks through the development of a Google Chrome plugin. By identifying and proposing alternative coding practices for common scenarios, GreenCode aims to reduce energy consumption in software development. In its current version, GreenCode has been built for four commonly used coding practices. This paper also presents a comparison of the energy consumption of these four coding practices and their alternatives. The effectiveness of GreenCode is validated through experiments on publicly available Python code, demonstrating significant reductions in energy usage. It is found that GreenCode gives favourable results for three of the four coding practices. Despite some limitations, GreenCode presents a promising solution for promoting eco-friendly coding practices and contributing to sustainability in the computing industry."
