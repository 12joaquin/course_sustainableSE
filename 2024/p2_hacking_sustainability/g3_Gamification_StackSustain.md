title: "StackSustain: a website for encouraging engagement in sustainability topics" 
summary: "We present StackSustain as a system to potentially fill the gap characterised by the lack of software that gamifies engagement in sustainability topics on StackOverflow, and related websites. In doing so, we attempt to promote sustainability and knowledge sharing in topics surrounding "green" software engineering."
